# GameHub RAWG

![GameHub website](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30121693/171004488-359b41af-29be-4329-8cc9-e9ed717b86cb.png)

[GameHub](https://pretzl-gamehub-rawg.netlify.app/) is a video game marketplace I created for my Cross-Course-Project at Noroff.

## Description

GameHub is a project we've iterated upon throughout the entire first year at Noroff. It began in our HTML/CSS course, and has progressed through JavaScript and Content Management Systems. I've split the site into two separate repos - one using WordPress to store and manage content, and another using the RAWG video game database API.

The main features are:

- Fully responsive
- RAWG API
- Completely based on vanilla JavaScript
- Search element
- Various ways of sorting and organizing content
- Dynamically updating based on the RAWG API

## Built With

- Vanilla JavaScript
- [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/)

## Getting Started

This project is already fully deployed, so there is no extra work required. Should you still want to deploy it yourself, follow the below steps.

### Installing

First off, clone the repo.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone pretzL/cross-course-project-pretzl-rawg
```

2. Upload and install to your preferred hosting provider.

This is usually done through the hosting's own file manager or via FTP. Check which one you should use through your hosting provider.

### Running

So long as you have uploaded the provided files and deployed it to a website, the project should be running and fetching content from the WordPress Headless CMS.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to first off acknowledge Noroff and its tutors for playing a vital part in my development career. I'd also like to acknowledge fellow student Toni for their help through acting as a rubber duck on multiple occasions, and providing helpful resources for solving various problems I've experienced throughout this project. I also want to acknowledge great resources such as the Web Dev Simplified YouTube channel for providing useful insight into programming and development. RAWG API's documentation has also been incredibly useful throughout this process, and has made me appreciate how easy it is to work with good documentation.
